This is a website buit for the re-opening event of Obelisk Language Center. Obelisk Language Center is a language school located in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, more precisely at the 20th Av / 9th and 10th on the second floor of the DaVinci's Commercial Center. This school is currently closed because of the pandemics and it really doesn't have a re-opening date, but lets hope things get better soon and Obelisk can restart operations!
